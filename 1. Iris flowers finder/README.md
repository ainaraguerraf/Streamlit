# Streamlit - Iris Flower Predictor

In this project I used the Iris dataset. 

I created a predictor of the Iris flower depending of some factors. 

#### How did I do it?
- I Created a new project in Pycharm
- I Installed Streamlit
- I created a local environment.
- I used a linnear regression model that I previosuly tried in a Jupyter notebook. 
- I created the predictor using the Streamlit library.

The front-end result is as follows:
