# Streamlit - Avocado Type Predictor

In this project I used this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices) that is meandt to use it to make machine learning models. 

I created a Price predictor of the avocado depending of the type of the avocado and the region. 
#### How did I do it?
- I Created a new project in Pycharm
- I Installed Streamlit
- I created a local environment.
- I used a linnear regression model that I previosuly tried in a Jupyter notebook. 
- I created the predictor using the Streamlit library.

The front-end result is as follows:
